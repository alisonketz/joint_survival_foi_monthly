"767",5070,2017-02-06,43224,">2yrs","Female","BAM bump at 10:36 (0.5 ml), very high temps so only collared, tagged, and released"
"764",7225,2017-02-19,24232,">2yrs","Male","Weight estimated 165 lbs. Temp increased, reversed early; did not take RAMALT or tooth.
[BAM bumped 18:16 with 0.5 ml after initial dose of 2 ml at 18:03.]"
"797",6048,2017-03-15,43271,">2yrs","Female","Three animals caught in one clover. Abrasions on head, alopecia. Legs hips in unnatural position in trap. Shaking, high temp. Went down quickly, light anesthesia so bumped (1.5 ml initial dose BAM plus 0.5 ml bump at 9:52). Reversed and released early due to hyperthermia. 
Quick reversal, no apparent complications."
"527",7208,2017-03-19,43217,">2yrs","Female","Bled profusely from eartag puncture. Adult doe, did not drug (have stopped drugging adult does due to possible drug effect on late pregnancy)"
"558",7368,2018-01-04,24957,">2yrs","Male","Went down hard. Head was twisted to the side. After BAM injection, head was adjusted. Took a bit for BAM to take affect. Dazed once reversal took affect. Got up walked towards crew before he took off. Too big for weigh net so did not weigh."
"793",5971,2018-01-07,NA,">2yrs","Female","Capture mortality.  Found dead in clover trap while checking the line that morning."
"136",5058,2018-01-15,43283,">2yrs","Female","Never fully induced, bleeding from mouth slightly. Large doe. Quick reversal and took off strong into the woods. Was calm for roughly 10-15 minutes. Got RAMALT and went back to being restless. Because of bleeding from mouth and head tossing, no tooth extraction. By the time VIT was attempted, was back to being restless so it was not attempted. Oxygen administered for ~20-25 minutes. Temp was initially a little, high, but it began to come down"
"221",5852,2018-02-08,80627,">2yrs","Female","Very shaky and ragged breathing.  Near end of processing she tried to stand up often.  RAMALT was taken and she had response to it (flicking tail and trying to stand)  Gave lidocaine in tooth but didn't pull it because she was too responsive.  Slight rectal bleeding from thermometer.  When giving reversal no blood on pull back but a small amount in needle after administering.  Quick recovery, ran away."
"244",5955,2018-02-09,80603,">2yrs","Female","Induction time an estimate. No snip, not a great RAMALT because she was waking up and was very twitchy.  Good recovery.  Used 0.5mL BAM out of bottle 429 and 1.5 BAM from bottle 418."
"159",5629,2018-03-07,43212,">2yrs","Female","Hair loss on left side in patches similar to mange.  Excreted blood clot and feces after RAMALT. No tooth extraction due to attempts to get up towards end of processing. Old doe collar.  Head up at 18:19. Induced quickly.  Did not make much of a fuss. Showed some movement, tail twitching towards end of processing.  Was confident in deer age so decided not to extract tooth.  Reversed and walked off well."
"543",7252,2018-03-11,80641,">2yrs","Female","Piece of ear was cut off from net, bled quite a bit. Went down really well and quick processing. Took awhile to get to net and untangle all deer after sedation. Got up quite well after reversal. Small cut above the rectum. Small hair loss on the body."
"259",6017,2018-03-27,29446,">2yrs","Male","Bam doses given in 3 separate injections. 2cc dart, 1cc bump and another 1cc bump. All BAM doses given with bottle 495. Buck went 300 yards before going down. Took awhile to find it but jumped up and tried to run upon approach. Was able to catch and restrain. After 3rd dose induced well. TPRs great. Stayed under well. Dart hit ideal location. Did not pull a tooth because it was already under for a very long time. Reversed well, strong release."
"176",5667,2019-01-11,81999,">2yrs","Female","Extremely tangled in net, was very tight on head. Took awhile to get out of net, deer wasn’t 100percent induced at that time, but needed to remove. Didn't pull a tooth because of lack of immobilization. Not fully under during most of work up, but then was good towards the end of processing. Got up and walked away well."
"585",7830,2019-01-18,82073,">2yrs","Female","2 bottles of Atipamezole used for reversal 1.5cc of 563 and 1.5cc of 640. Thermometer may not have been working in the cold.  Deer stumbled a little when helped up at reversal, once assisted a second time, she got up well."
"293",6512,2019-01-21,82052,">2yrs","Female","Head and neck were under body while caught in net, stuck in a fetal position with head kinked under feet. Breathing sounded like deer had an airbubble stuck, as if it was trying to regurgitate, even when repositioned and administered o2 throughout processing. Injected lidocaine in left gum, but ran out of time to pull tooth. Weren't able to get much of a blood sample. Reversal was smooth, got up and walked away well."
"328",6586,2019-01-25,82065,">2yrs","Female","Deer induced quickly. Processing went smoothly. Could not pull blood- deer kept pulling HR leg back in so we tried from the other side (HL) and were not able to do so here either. No tooth pulled as time was running out. Reversed well, got up and trotted off with buck fawn."
"160",5631,2019-01-26,82070,">2yrs","Female",".8cc of #568 BAM wasted- drawn up and never injected into deer, froze in syringe. Deer took awhile to induce. Was still responsive to snapping in ears at 1020, so bumped with .3cc BAM. Never seemed to fully induce; moved head and neck throughout processing, yet didn’t respond to invasive stimuli such as earpunches and RAMALT. Large deer, likely quite old but didn't pull tooth due to state of induction. Got up slowly at reversal, walked away very slowly."
"407",6772,2019-02-04,82068,">2yrs","Female","Breathing heavy/snorting while under net, nose pinned in net against snow. Entangled closely with other deer in net. Loud growling in lungs when listening to heart beat. High temperature, put alcohol in pits and over legs. Deer was shivering violently, shaking almost entire processing. Started waking up near end of processing while being weighed. Walked away very slowly at reversal, circling the net a few times then eventually ran off after a few minutes."
"106",5583,2019-02-13,82016,">2yrs","Female","Deer did not induce well. Bumped with .5cc at 18:31, bumped again with .75cc at 18:43. Responsive and getting up after initial injection and first bump. Still moving after second bump but eventually stayed under enough to get processing completed. Pulled away when attempting to age so no tooth was pulled. Twitching and jerking throughout processing. Reversal had some shaking, but overall was smooth and deer walked away fine. Some blood from reversal injection site."
"810",6794,2019-02-13,82019,">2yrs","Female","*Aged as yearling at capture, but based on teeth at death 10/15/20, deer appeared 4yrs old. Therefore likely 2+ at capture.Deer tried to get up after removing from net, but then induced completely. Reversed quickly."
"394",6742,2019-02-19,43208,">2yrs","Female","Initial injection of BAM was 1.5cc from bottle 682. Bumped once at 10:44 using 2 bottles of BAM: .10cc from 685 and .15cc from 682. Deer was caught in a clover trap with a buck fawn. She was missing a patch of hair on her right backstrap area. Skin scraped off above right hind hoof when right leg was stuck in netting of trap. Breathing heavy and irregular upon restraint, breathing stabilized once induced and throughout processing. Had a lot of very dry pellets in rectum. RAMALT sample was oddly shaped and a bit small. Took a very long time to reverse. Layed with head up for a long time, still seeming asleep. Trotted off well once she did rise."
"99",5569,2019-03-03,82053,">2yrs","Female","Fought restraint but induced well. Smooth processing. She had a bruise on her under-tail just above the rectum. Missing a patch of hair on her back by her tail. Reversal given in two locations, part of dosage on each hind leg. Drew blood on 2nd location, so removed and injected in a new spot. Originally got up at 16:39 and bolted away, but fell back down as if she went back to sleep and layed there awhile. She got back up on her own at 16:49 and walked away very slowly."
"498",7027,2019-03-04,82061,">2yrs","Female","Induced well. Moved some when pulled out of net and throughout processing, but was unresponsive to ear tags or RAMALT. Had a low heart rate. Very fast reversal, walked away well."
"18",5179,2019-03-06,80620,">2yrs","Female","2 bottles of ATI used for reversal, .4cc from 689 and 2.6cc from 693. Deer bit tongue when captured, was bleeding in its mouth. Had a gash on left cheek and behind left ear (see photos in body photos folder). Was breathing heavy when tangled but rate leveled out when drugged. Caught with feet tangled up by her head. Smooth reversal."
"342",6616,2019-03-11,43228,">2yrs","Female","Large deer, teeth very worn. Attempted tooth extraction, but tooth broke off and root was left in gum. Left eye was blood shot upon restraint. TPRs were stable. RAMALT ripped, rectum slightly prolapsed and bled when thermometer was first inserted. Deer got up right away when approached by crew member. She peed while waking up."
"802",5536,2019-03-20,82075,">2yrs","Female","Adult doe not drugged. Quick processing, about 10min.  She was given a collar and eartags and was released.  Blindfold was not taken off, so she ran around in a circle, ran into the driveway and into the truck and blindfold was able to be removed. She did not appear injured and ran away into the woods."
"78",5538,2020-01-17,80576,">2yrs","Female","Deer not fully induced after 15min, gave .5cc bump of BAM from bottle 794. OG dose was 1.5cc from bottle 794. Induced further after bump but still moved head and legs some. Shaky throughout processing. Shaky during reversal as well. Ran away fine after fully waking up."
"331",6594,2020-02-10,84637,">2yrs","Female","Deer did not induce well. Was breathing very fast and shook throughout processing. Did not pull a tooth because of this. Her 1st tooth was very small with visible staining. She is likely 2 yrs old. When reversed she got hind legs stuck in a fence. We helped remove them and saw no visible injuries."
"346",6625,2020-02-11,40415,">2yrs","Male","Deer induced well. Smooth processing. Tried to pull tooth but tooth broke at root and could not get it out. The deer reversal went well and the deer walked back to where it came from. Antlered buck."
"338",6608,2020-02-13,80609,">2yrs","Female","Restrained quickly and in good position in trap. Steady breathing through induction but shaking and trying to stand, then relaxing. Shaking less during processing. Quick and smooth processing, stable TPRs. Shaking harder after reversal, placed jackets on her. Slow to reverse, but got up well and ran away well."
"656",8141,2020-02-13,40424,">2yrs","Male","Collapsed trap for restraint. Deer's snout got stuck in back of netting and netting went into its mouth. Lower lip separated from the jaw and is all floppy and bleeding. Photos in body photos folder. Skinny deer. Still had full rack. Smooth recovery. 2 bottles ATI used at reversal, 2.5 from 787 and 1.5 from 810. Ear tag 8142 was ripped out during a recaputre in a trap a few weeks later"
"158",5627,2020-02-20,24974,">2yrs","Male","Head caught and tangled in net but breathing fast but okay during induction. Moving head in lolling motion through beginning of processing. Stopped 3/4 of the way through. Otherwise stable processing. Slow to reverse, bumped with 1.0cc ATI at 19:20. Walked off well."
"356",6646,2020-02-20,28435,">2yrs","Male","Wound on lower back center, photo in body photo folder. Almost looked like a re-opened exit wound from an arrow. TPRs consistent throughout. Could not pull a tooth, no pliers. Induced well. Took a little while for him to get up, but otherwise smooth. Aspirating a bit."
"567",7733,2020-02-26,82004,">2yrs","Female","Stuck in net in a bad position, very tangled. Took awhile to get out of net. Reversal smooth, got up quickly. Smooth processing."
